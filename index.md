My current research is on the security and performance of blockchain protocols. I am also broadly interested in consensus protocols, cryptography, information theory and their intersections. I am grateful to have [Prof. David Tse](https://tselab.stanford.edu/) as my PhD advisor. During my PhD, I have done internships with [Celestia](https://celestia.org/), [Babylon Labs](https://babylonlabs.io/), and [a16z crypto research](https://a16zcrypto.com/research/).

For more details about my research and publications, please look at my [CV](CV.pdf).
